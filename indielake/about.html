The scenic locales inside the campus have always been a treat to the eye. It took great foresight and prowess of imagination to transform the boat club into a venue that is now dedicated to music and peace. Owing to the efforts of its team, <span class="more-space">INDIE&nbsp;LAKE</span> was held for the first time ever in 2015 in the erstwhile Boat Club. Supposed be an acoustic event by the lake on lines of the Woodstock Festival, it turned out to be a huge success. Comprising of two events <span class="more-space">INDIE LAKE UNPLUGGED</span> and <span class="more-space">THE VOICE OF INCAND</span> held on two separate days, Indie lake has always aimed to be a harbinger of change and a promoter of harmony, love and peace. In a world plagued by conflicts and complexities, Indie Lake in its own way has always tried to contribute to spreading the message of peace through music. Indie Lake is not only about the music and the performances. The lights, the decoration and the ambience are as much as a part of Indie Lake as the music is. When everything comes together and forms an eclectic mix, the result is extraordinary. </p><p style="text-align:justify; color:#333; font-family:Lato; font-size:1.2em; line-height:1.5em; margin:2em 1em; word-spacing:+5px; font-weight:500;">Last year Indie Lake was fortunate enough to have Barry Kharnaior and Andrew Mawlot to form the esteemed panel of judges. Sunep Oz was eventually declared the winner of Voice of Incand 2015 with Arantxa Wanchi Simsang coming a close second. On the other hand, Fuzz Town were declared the winners of Indie Lake Unplugged and Children of Hope were the runners up. This year too, Indie Lake 2.0 is expected to bring in a very famous name as its judge and headliner. Furthermore, the theme for this year's Indie Lake is "psychedelia" with focus being laid on psychedelic music. Hence, the number of participants and entries is expected to increase manifold. </p><p style="text-align:justify; color:#333; font-family:Lato; font-size:1.2em; line-height:1.5em; margin:2em 1em; word-spacing:+5px; font-weight:500;">Apart from the acoustic events, a dj night was also held in the 2015 edition which turned out to be a major hit among the masses. Also, a guitar ensemble of the legendary Bob Dylan number "Knocking on Heaven's door" was staged last year in which about 30 people participated. The venue is surrounded by many stalls which provide tiaras and glow bands at a minimal prize. The Indie Lake crew also lights up flying lanterns which allure the audience and keep them in complete awe. </p></section><div class="ribbon"></div></div></div><div class="col-sm-2"></div><script src="js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script> <script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script></body></html>
